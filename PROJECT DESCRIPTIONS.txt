Step 1: Create an S3 Bucket
-----------------------------
Go to S3: In the AWS Management Console, search for S3 in the "Find Services" box, and click on it.
Create a Bucket:
Click on the Create bucket button.
Choose a unique name for your bucket (the name must be globally unique).
Select a region where you want your website to be hosted (e.g., US East (N. Virginia)).
Leave other settings at their defaults unless you need specific configurations.
Click Create bucket.

Step 2: Upload Your Website Files to S3
-----------------------------------------
Open the newly created bucket.
Click on the Upload button.
Add your website files (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, images, etc.) from your local computer.
Make sure your index.html file (or whatever your main page is) is present.
If you have other assets like images or fonts, upload those as well.
Click Upload to finish uploading your files.


Step 3: Set Bucket Policy for Public Access
------------------------------------------------

Go to the Permissions tab in your S3 bucket.

Scroll down to Block public access (bucket settings) and click on Edit.

Uncheck Block all public access and acknowledge the warning about public access.

Click Save changes.

This step is essential to allow public access to your website.



Step 4: Configure S3 for Static Website HostinG
----------------------------------------------------
Go to the Properties tab of your S3 bucket.
Scroll down to Static website hosting.
Click on Enable.
Set Index document to index.html (or whatever your main page file is).
Set Error document to error.html (optional, but helpful for error handling).
Click Save changes.


Step 5: Get the Website URL
-------------------------------------------------
After enabling static website hosting, youâ€™ll see a Bucket website endpoint at the bottom of the Static website hosting settings.
This URL will look like https://personal-webbucketsami.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/portfolio_website.html
For example: https://personal-webbucketsami.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/portfolio_website.html
You can now use this URL to access your portfolio website.
